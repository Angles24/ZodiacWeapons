Before you start, open the Start.xml and set your desired job to 1, all other jobs to 0. Only set one job to 1 or it will confuse the profiles.

In the Start.xml you will find a list of items, one for each job. You must buy this item and meld it with the required materia (also listed) and have it in your inventory before starting the profile.
